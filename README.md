I'm a ~~college student~~ software engineer with immense interest in the field of
programming and generally, solving tough problems. I'm also interested in many
other fields such as **mathematics** ‚ûï, **chemistry** üß™, **biomedical** üíä,
**psychology** üß†, and **astronomy** ‚≠êÔ∏è. I sought to integrate new technologies
and ideas from different fields.

I use **Python** üêç *hssss* mainly for general programming, and mainly
**TypeScript** for web-related stuff. Currently learning **Go** and **Rust**!

Oh yeah. I also like anime and gaming, mostly in **casual**, **simulation**, and
**survival** genres. I also recently became a helper staff at
[**Python Discord**](https://discord.gg/python). Whether you want to start
programming with Python or have had eons of experience, join over 100,000
Pythonists in the [server](https://discord.gg/python)!
